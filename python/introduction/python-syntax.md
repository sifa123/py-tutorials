# Python syntax

Ok, welcome back!

I would be sharing here on the basic syntaxes of python but before that, let's write our first python code, if
that. I our previous page you were told on how to run python code either through a
- A command line/ prompt or a python shell directly
- or saving a .py file using your editor and then run it with your terminal.

## Writing my First Python Program
As stated above you can use any one of the options for now.

### Using a Python Shell / Command Prompt  
- You can type this directly into your python shell ```print('Hello World')```
- Using your command prompt, you need to type the word `python` first to signal the command prompt that you want
to use python or write a python code, then something like this should pop-up after
```
Python 3.9.2 (tags/v3.9.2:1a79785, Feb 19 2021, 13:44:55) [MSC v.1928 64 bit (AMD64)] on win32
Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
```
(The version of python you have installed on your system and others.). Afterward you should see something like this `>>>`, a python shell indicator.
Then you can go ahead to write down your code ```print('Hello World')```.

Your output should be `Hello World`, the `print` function would surely print out anything(strings) found in that bracket. I would be explaining the `print()` function in the tutorial ahead.

## Python Operators



# Python Comments
- Comments can be used to explain Python code.
- Comments can be used to make the code more readable.
- Comments can be used to prevent execution when testing code.

Creating a Comment starts with a #, and Python will ignore them:

<b>Example<b>
```
# This is a comment
print('Hello World')
```


## Python Indentation
Indentation  can be said to be spaces at the beginning of a code line. This is very important in the python language, an indentation(space) error causes code to have bugs(tracebacks, errors).
