## What is python?
The python we are talking about here is not a snake, lolðŸ˜…~~ It is a programming language used to do so many things. Many things like what?
- Web development
- Game development
- Data science
- Machine learning and so on

We call python developers, a [pythonista](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Pythonista#:~:text=Noun,uses%20the%20Python%20programming%20language). 
So, you are on the verge of the journey of being a pythonista. Before we go any further, do you know the inventor of python? 
If yes that's great but if no, not bad, his name is [Guido Van Rossum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guido_van_Rossum).


## Python in interactive mode vs script mode

- <strong>Interactive Mode</strong>

   Yeah, we can write python interactively i.e communicating by writing the codes and python would be replying giving you the output immediately.
   - This is good for the experiment and tweaking of codes that are 3 to 4 lines long
   - It is not advisable to use this mode with longer lines of codes
   - Using a python terminal to execute codes

- <strong>Script Mode</strong>

   This is writing/run sequence of lines, commands/statements into a file using a code editor(IDE)
   - In a sense, we are giving python a script to execute
   - Add .py as the suffix while saving the files to indicate it is a python file/script.
