# Getting You Ready
Yeah, welcome! 

You want to be a programmer, wow that's cool. So let's prepare you ahead for the journey.
As a programmer you must serve the user, using your codes and programs to satisfy their needs and meet their satisfaction.
A programmer is the intermediary between the hardware problem and the users. 

### Codes & Bugs
You would face a lot of bug, but do not be afraid because even experts face same and also do well, this means that there is no escape from that but have 
in mind that you are a real developer when you are commited, dedicated and unrelenting in making your codes right.
I consider any code that does not meet the intended expectation of a programmer or a user a bug, why?
- Codes are called codes beacuse it solves an intended problem or let's say a problem
- Bugs are called bugs because it has nothing to offer, no value but problems
### Codes makes use of:
- Data
- Information
- Network
