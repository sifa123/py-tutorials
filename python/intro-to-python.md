# Python

## What is Python?
The python we are talking about here is not a snake, lolðŸ˜…~~ It is a programming language used to do so many things. Many things like what?
- Web development,
- Software development,
- Game development,
- Data science,
- Mathematics,
- System scripting,
- Machine learning and so on

We call python developers, a [pythonista](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Pythonista#:~:text=Noun,uses%20the%20Python%20programming%20language).
So, you are on the verge of the journey of being a pythonista. Before we go any further, do you know the inventor of python?
If yes that's great but if no, not bad, his name is [Guido Van Rossum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guido_van_Rossum) and python got released in the year 1991.

## What can Python do?
- Python can be used on a server to create web applications.
- Python can be used alongside software to create workflows.
- Python can connect to database systems. It can also read and modify files.
- Python can be used to handle big data and perform complex mathematics.
- Python can be used for rapid prototyping, or for production-ready software development.

## Getting Python Installed
I think most PCs have Python installed, to check if yours have Python installed. Run this code in yours
commands line/prompt ```python --version```. The output of that command is meant to show you the version
of python you have installed, if something like an error pops out, then there is an error truly.

## Python in Interactive Mode vs Script Mode

- <strong>Interactive Mode</strong>

   Yeah, we can write python interactively i.e communicating by writing the codes and python would be replying giving you the output immediately.
   - This is good for the experiment and tweaking of codes that are 3 to 4 lines long
   - It is not advisable to use this mode with longer lines of codes
   - Using a python terminal or to execute codes

- <strong>Script Mode</strong>

   This is writing/run sequence of lines, commands/statements into a file using a code editor(IDE)
   - In a sense, we are giving python a script to execute
   - Add .py as the suffix while saving the files to indicate it is a python file/script.
   - Using your Command Prompt/ line to run your codes.
     - Open your Command Prompt
     - Navigate to the directory where your code was stored `mycode.py`
     - Then type down the name of the file and click the `enter` button
